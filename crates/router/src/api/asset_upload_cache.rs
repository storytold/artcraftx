//! Skip re-uploading bytes a provider already holds.
//!
//! The router uploads reference media to providers on the caller's behalf
//! (Higgsfield today). The app keeps a ledger of what each account has
//! already uploaded, keyed by content hash; it hands the router a
//! per-account view of that ledger through this trait, and the router asks
//! before every upload. The router has no idea how the ledger is stored.
//!
//! Entries are advisory: the router verifies a hit with the provider before
//! trusting it, and any failure falls back to a fresh upload that is then
//! recorded over the stale entry.
