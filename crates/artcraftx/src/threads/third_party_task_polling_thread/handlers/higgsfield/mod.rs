//! First-party (cookie-session) Higgsfield jobs. A task's `provider_job_id`
//! holds every job id of the Higgsfield job set (comma-separated for a
//! batch); the poller checks them in one batch-status call per account and,
//! once every job is terminal, downloads the finished files and hands them
//! to the shared completion routine.
