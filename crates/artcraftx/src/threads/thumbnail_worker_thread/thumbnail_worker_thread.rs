//! Background thumbnail generation for downloaded results.
//!
//! Work arrives two ways:
//!
//! 1. Downloaders push the files they just wrote onto the
//!    [`ThumbnailWorkQueue`], which wakes this thread immediately.
//! 2. Every [`SCAN_INTERVAL`] the thread asks both databases what's owed:
//!    `local_files` rows still pending (retryable, or made by an older
//!    generator), and the most recently completed tasks' downloads that have
//!    no current thumbnail yet — so history from before this thread existed,
//!    and anything a missed wake-up skipped, still gets done.
//!
//! Each finished thumbnail is announced with `local_thumbnail_ready_event`
//! so the task queue can show it without re-polling.
